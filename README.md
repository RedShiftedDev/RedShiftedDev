Hey, I’m @RedShiftedDev

I’m passionate about computational physics, where I explore numerical simulations, high-performance computing, and data-driven models to solve real-world physics problems.

- What I’m working on:
  +	Optimized matrix multiplication using OpenMP, and tiling techniques for maximum performance
  +	A C++ plotting library inspired by Matplotlib, focusing on efficiency and flexibility
  +	Developing my own Machine Learning Library/API in modern C++ (20/23).
  +	Various simulation projects, including orbital mechanics and physics-based modeling
  +	Handwritten Digit Classifier: Trained a model from scratch without TensorFlow, using only fundamental ML concepts, using my own Library in c++

- Currently Learning:
  +	Advanced integration algorithms and their computational implementations.
  +	Performance tuning techniques for scientific computing on modern hardware.

- Looking to collaborate on:
  +	If you’re into high-performance numerical computing, physics simulations, or C++ optimizations.

- Tech Stack:
	+ Languages: C/C++, Python (SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib), POVRay, LaTex, MathLab, Bash, Julia, Java.
	  -	Frameworks & Tools: Wolfarm Mathematica, MATLAB, Blender, ROOT, SFML, OpenMP, PyQt, OpenGL v4.1.
	  -	Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows.
