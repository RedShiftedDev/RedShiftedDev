Hey, I’m @RedShiftedDev

I’m passionate about computational physics, where I explore numerical simulations, high-performance computing, and data-driven models to solve real-world physics problems.

- What I’m working on:
  - [x] Optimized matrix multiplication using OpenMP, and tiling techniques for maximum performance
  - [x] A C++ plotting library inspired by Matplotlib, focusing on efficiency and flexibility
  - [x] Developing my own Machine Learning Library/API in modern C++ (20/23).
  - [x] Various simulation projects, including orbital mechanics and physics-based modeling
  - [ ] Handwritten Digit Classifier: Developing a model from scratch without TensorFlow, using only fundamental ML concepts, using my own Library in C++

- Currently Learning:
  +	Advanced integration algorithms and their computational implementations.
  +	Performance tuning techniques for scientific computing on modern hardware.

- Looking to collaborate on:
  +	If you’re into high-performance numerical computing, physics simulations, or C++ optimizations.
  +	In Machine Learning Developing a model (CNN, NN, Forest Tree, SVM)

- Knowledge Stack:
	+ Languages:
		- C/C++
  		- Python (SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib)
    		- POVRay
	        - LaTex
	        - MathLab
	        - Julia (Image Processing)
	        - Java (Created a MazeGame without a Game Engine)
           	- Bash (basics)
	+ Frameworks & Tools: Wolfarm Mathematica, MATLAB, Blender, ROOT, SFML, OpenMP, PyQt, OpenGL v4.1.
	+ Data Structure and Algorithms.
	+ Platforms: macOS, Linux.
