Hey, I’m @RedShiftedDev

I’m passionate about computational physics, where I explore numerical simulations, high-performance computing, and data-driven models to solve real-world physics problems.

- What I’m working on:
  •	Optimized matrix multiplication using OpenMP, and tiling techniques for maximum performance
  •	A C++ plotting library inspired by Matplotlib, focusing on efficiency and flexibility
  •	Various simulation projects, including orbital mechanics and physics-based modeling

- Currently Learning:
	•	Advanced integration algorithms and their computational implementations
	•	Performance tuning techniques for scientific computing on modern hardware

- Looking to collaborate on:

- If you’re into high-performance numerical computing, physics simulations, or C++ optimizations.

- Tech Stack:
	•	Languages: C/C++, Python (SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib), POVRay, LaTex, MathLab, Bash, Julia, Java.
	•	Frameworks & Tools: ROOT, SFML, OpenMP, PyQt, Firebase, OpenGL-4.1, Wolfarm Mathematica, MathLab, Blender...
	•	Platforms: macOS, Linux, Windows
